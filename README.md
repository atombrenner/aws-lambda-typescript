# AWS Lambda Typescript Boilerplate Code

Fork this repository to quickstart lambda function development with Typescript. Perfect for microservices.

## Features

- build and deploy in seconds, thanks to esbuild and using the AWS Lambda API directly
- minified bundles (less space, faster startup, faster deployment)
- full source map support with readable stack traces
- infrastructure as code with Cloudformation
- Jest as a testing framework
- the whole tool chain is just typescript files, no need to install additional tools like aws-cli or zip
- uses tsx to execute typescript files (which is also leveraging esbuild)

## Prerequisites

- run `npm ci`

## Commands

- `npm test` execute tests with jest
- `npm run build` create ./dist/lambda.js bundle
- `npm run zip` create the ./dist/lambda.zip from ./dist/lambda.js and ./dist/lambda.js.map
- `npm run dist` run all of the above steps
- `npm run stack` create or update the CloudFormation stack
- `npm run deploy` used to deploy ./dist/lambda.zip to the created lambda function
- `npm start` will start the lambda function locally

Hint: Currently the region and profile is hardcoded to eu-west-1 in [stack.ts](./infrastructure/stack.ts).
You can remove this and use AWS environment parameters instead.
Example:

```
AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 AWS_PROFILE=atombrenner npm run stack
```

## Tools

- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
- [tsx](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx/) for executing scripts written in TypeScript
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as a Jest transformer
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for managing git hooks, e.g. run tests before committing

### Deprecated Tools

- [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)
- [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html) for managing infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation

## Learnings

### Replaced ts-node with tsx

I used ts-node for many years, it helped me and many of my teams to write automation scripts
in TypeScript instead of bash or ruby. With the introduction of ESM and the slow
migration from CommonJS to ESM correct configuration of ts-node got harder and harder.
With node 20 ts-node stopped working for ESM modules at all. Not the fault of ts-node (see
[here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47880) for details) but even after months
it was never fixed or the workaround was too esoteric for me.
I found tsx, which is powered by esbuild, and it works like a charm for scripts that are
part of an esm package without special config.

### Dropped CDK

Dropped CDK because it was too heavy-weight for simple lambda microservices.
It was hard to maintain a second package.json and tsconfig.json just for CDK.
Having a single Cloudformation template and deploy it via API is much faster and easier to maintain.
The function can be updated (deployed) by a simple API call, decoupled from other infrastructure updates.
Deploying a new version or rolling back to an old one takes only a few seconds.,

### Using esbuild

Switched to use [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for transpiling and bundling lambda typescript source.
Compared to webpack, esbuild configuration is minimal and it is unbelievably fast.
The generated bundle is slightly larger than with webpack, but for AWS Lambdas a waste of a few kilobytes doesn't matter.
The important thing is, that all needed dependencies are bundled and all the noise from node_modules (tests, sources, readme, etc) is excluded.
As esbuild is only transpiling typescript, a separate call to `tsc` run is necessary for `npm run dist`.

- generate and use source maps to have readable stack traces in production
- `--sourcemap --sources-content=false` generates a small source-map without embedded sources
- `--keepnames` does not minifiy names which makes stack traces even more human-readable
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--enable-source-maps` enables experimental source-map support in AWS Lambda nodejs
